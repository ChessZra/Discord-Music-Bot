# "CrossfadeX" Music Bot
A discord music bot that is inspired by the popular "Rythm" bot that's been banned from Discord. It allows you to fetch any video on YouTube and play it back on the Discord voice chat. It utilizes the Lavalink player, which provides high-quality audio playback.

# Features
"Rythm" has the following features:

Play any video on YouTube in a Discord voice channel.

Pause, resume, skip, and stop the playback of the current track.

Display information about the current track.

Implemented an autoplay class that utilizes the YouTube API to automatically play similar songs based on the current track.

Other commands include: !leave, !autoplay, !play, !join, !pause, !resume, !skip, !skipto, !forceskip, !stop, !remove, !queue, !lyrics, !crossfade (contact me if you're interested as this utilizes another bot as the second player in charge for the crossfade-effect),
!playlist (coming soon).

# Usage
To use Rythm-Clone, invite it to your Discord server and type !play [YouTube link or search query] in any text channel. Rythm-Clone will then join your voice channel and play the requested video.

You can control the playback using the following commands:

* !pause: Pause the current track.
* !resume: Resume the playback of the current track.
* !skip: Skip to the next track in the queue.
* !skipto [track number]: Skip to a specific track in the queue.
* !forceskip: Force skip the current track.
* !stop: Stop the playback of the current track and clear the queue.
* !remove [track number]: Remove a specific track from the queue.
* !queue: Display the current queue.
* !lyrics: Display the lyrics of the current track.
* !autoplay [on/off]: Enable or disable the autoplay feature.
* !leave: Leave the voice channel.
